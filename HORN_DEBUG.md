I noticed some of the 2d horn profiles not calculating the correct profile. ideally the user should define the size of the horn and desired dispersion of the x and y axis and the profile will be calculated form that. Do a deep dive to generate perfect horn profiles with these inputs. Keep in mind multiple profiles might need to be calculated for rectangular horns or horns with varying dispersion (ie: 120 degrees on the bottom of the horn but 45 degrees at the top. variable dispersion is not supported yet but keep the profiles agnostic of the type of horn they will be used in) dispersion would be in degrees at the -6db point. offer a way to calculate and visualize dispersion patterns in 2d for x and y axis. after the profiles are calculated, calculate the expected frequency response with a compression drivers that plays a flat response throughout the frequency range (ie ideal case, we will iterate over this in the future and allow users to enter driver data to calculate real world response data) group each of these calculations in their own file/folder to keep the code clean.
